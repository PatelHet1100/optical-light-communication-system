# Reconstruction Plan

## Rebuild Requirements
- Laser diode with proper current driver
- Stable power supply
- Rigid optical mounts
- Improved receiver amplification
- Optional digital encoding stage

## Why Reconstruction Has Not Occurred
- Academic commitments
- Time constraints
- Priority on documentation and theory

## Conditions for Reconstruction
Rebuilding will be considered if:
- Extended experimentation is required
- Digital modulation is implemented
- Visual documentation is needed for publication or demonstration

Until then, this repository serves as a complete design and learning record.
