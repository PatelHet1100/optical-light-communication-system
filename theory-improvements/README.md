# Theoretical Improvements and Later Insights

## Digital Encoding Concept
A major improvement identified later was replacing analog audio with:
- Binary encoding
- Morse-style pulse transmission
- On-off keying (OOK)

This would:
- Reduce noise sensitivity
- Improve data integrity
- Allow text-based communication

## Signal Conditioning
Potential improvements include:
- Proper laser current drivers
- Optical filtering
- Envelope detection at receiver
- Automatic gain control

## Why These Were Not Implemented
At the time of construction:
- Knowledge of digital modulation was limited
- Focus was on proof-of-concept
- Component availability was constrained

These ideas are documented to track conceptual growth.
