# Experimental Observations

## Runtime
- Observed continuous operation: ~2–3 hours
- No long-term endurance testing performed

## Audio Quality
- Speech was clearly understandable
- Audio quality improved significantly with amplification
- Higher volumes introduced noticeable distortion

## Environmental Effects
- Night and low-light conditions produced best results
- Daylight operation was possible but noisier
- Direct sunlight increased background interference

## Failure Modes
- Laser heating during long operation
- Power instability
- Alignment drift
- Potential data loss at larger scale or distance

These limitations were accepted during experimentation.
