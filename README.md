# Laser-Based Optical Audio Communication System

This repository documents a laser-based optical communication system built around **2019–2020**, when I was approximately **14–15 years old**. The system enabled **full-duplex audio communication** between two floors of the same building using **free-space optical transmission**, without Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or wired connections.

The original prototype no longer exists. This repository serves as a **historical engineering record**, combined with **theoretical improvements and reconstruction planning** based on later understanding.

## Project Summary
- Communication medium: Visible laser light
- Transmission type: Analog audio modulation
- Directionality: Full duplex (simultaneous two-way audio)
- Receiver: Mini solar panel
- Environment: Residential apartment (floor-to-floor)
- Cost focus: Low-cost, easily available components

## Why this repository exists
At the time of construction, the project was built experimentally without formal documentation. This repository exists to:
- Preserve the system design and reasoning
- Document limitations and failure modes honestly
- Track theoretical improvements discovered later
- Enable structured reconstruction in the future

This is **not a polished product**, but a **learning-driven engineering system**.

## Current Status
- Hardware: Not currently assembled
- Documentation: Active
- Reconstruction: Planned (see reconstruction-plan)
