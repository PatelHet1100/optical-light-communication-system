# Optical Routing and Alignment

## Physical Geometry
The laser path was not a straight vertical line. Instead, mirrors were used to:
- Redirect the beam out of the window
- Route it vertically between floors
- Redirect it back into the receiving window

This allowed communication despite structural obstacles.

## Mirror Mounting
- Mirrors were mounted on a single rigid plank
- The plank was placed close to the window frame
- Only the reflected beam exited the window

This minimized vibration caused by:
- Human movement
- Airflow
- Structural resonance

## Alignment Challenges
- Alignment was the most sensitive part of the system
- Small angular deviations caused signal loss
- Stability improved significantly when mounted near fixed structures

## Key Insight
Optical communication is **geometrically fragile**. Mechanical stability is as important as electronic design.
